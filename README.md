# data-cleaning-tool
A prototype built in Python to prepare data ready for visualisation

This is a prototype application built in Python to do data mining without touching code. It loads, cleans, wrangles, exports to file and visualises data. The GUI was built using the Tkinker library which prompts user to load a dataset, clean it and then export it as a JSON. A GUI was built to make it easier for non-coders. The client initially needed the program to generate the mean, mode and median for the inspection score per year for each type of vendor’s seating and for each ‘zip code’ therefore these functions were built into the visualisation tool. Furthermore, the client wanted a way to save/export the cleaned data file and visualisations.
